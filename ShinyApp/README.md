# Ion Exchange Modeling Tool

The Ion Exchange Model is a tool used to measure the concentration of PFAS chemicals in drinking water over time given the initial conditions. 'Ion Exchange' in this context refers to a particular method of drinking water treatment where the contaminated drinking water passes through a resin column and _____________. To read a further in depth analysis of the theory behind this model please check out ________.  This tool can be used to determine if Ion Exchange or another method like Granular Activated Carbon is the most efficient for a given water treatment facility.

### Parameters

The parameters tab is used to describe the physical constraints of the resin characteristics and column specifications. Some of these measurements, like Resin Capacity, can be nontrivial to measure so we have tried to supply a source where the user can find the information if they do not have it already.


|  Input        				|Variable  | Description    | Source |
|---            				|---       |---            |---        |
|Resin Capacity 				|     Q    | Resin capacity is a measurement of the total capacity of PFAS that can be absorbed by a volume of resin. This capacity is expressed in quantity per unit volume. The value needs to be determined experimentally by titration, usually given by the manufacturing company.      |
|Bead Radius    				|     rb   | Bead radius is the measurement of the distance of the bead resin from the center to the surface.              |        |
|Bed Porosity   				|     EBED | The bed porosity is the measure of a bed volume occupied by a solvent, usually PFAS chemicals. This factor is between 0 and 1, where 0 represents a bed absent of a particular solvent and 1 is a bed where all the available space is filled with solvent.              |        |
|Length         				|     L    |Effective length of the column.               |        |
|Velocity  					|     v    | The linear velocity that represents the distance an average water particle travels over a given period of time.     |    |
|Diameter   				|     d    |  The longest distance between one point to the other of the exit.             |        |
|Flow Rate					|	fr   | The flow rate represents the distance one unit volume travels through the cylinder over a given period of time. |        |
|Radial Collocation Points		|	nr   |Mathetmical Object used to stablilize numeric fluctuations in a differential equation.               |        |
|Axial Collocation Points		|	nz   |               |        |
|Volumetric and Linear Velocity	|        |There are two options for chosing the input velocity: Volumetric (Flow rate) or Linear. Both options are available in this tool. If volumetric velocity is chosen, then length, diameter, and flow rate must all be supplied before the analysis is ran. If linear velocity is chosen then the user only needs length and velocity. This is because the tool by default takes linear velocity and when a volumetric velocity is given then the flow rate must be converted to linear velocity.               |        |

#### Notes of Resin Capacity (Q)
The total ion exchange capacity of the resin (Q) is one of the critical input parameters in the HSDMIX Shiny application. This quanitity is defined as the concentration of available exchange sites per unit volume inside a resin bead. This basiss is used in the unerlying model equations. However, several other conventions for defining this quanitity are used in practice. The filter capacity (Q<sub>f</sub>) is commonly provided by resin manufacturers and corresponds to the concentration of fixed sites per volume of the resin bed (that is, the filter). The values of Q and Q<sub>f</sub> are related by bed porosity ($\epsilon$) [EBED in HSDMIX] through equation 1.

$$ Q={Q_f \over 1-\epsilon} $$

Typical units for Q and Q<sub>f</sub> in the literature are meq/mL, meq/L, or eq/mL. Alternatively, the ion exchange capacity of a resin is sometimes defined on a dry weight basis (Q<sub>m</sub>). The dry weight capacity can be related to Q either by apparent resin density ($\rho$<sub>a</sub>)[RHOP in a Python version of HSDMIX], which is the dry mass of a pellet divided by the pellet's volume when fully hydrated, or through the apparent resin density of the bed ($\rho$<sup>*</sup>), which is the mass of dry resin per filter volume. The relationships between Q<sub>m</sub> and Q are given by equation 2.

$$ Q = {\rho^* Q_m \over 1-\epsilon} = {\rho_a Q_m} $$

Because resin volume and density can change with ionic composition of the resin, Q, Q<sub>f</sub>, and Q<sub>m</sub> may be different for resin in different ionic forms (for instance, hydroxide vs chloride forms of anion exchange resins). There is also some variability in the literature on what is considered "dry" (completely dry, or air dry) for Q<sub>m</sub>. The user is advised to carefully check data sources for resin capacity carefully on these matters. 

### Ions
The ions tab is present in order to organize the chemicals that are present in the analysis. This tab can be updated in either excel or in the Ion Exchange app. The ions are added by row with the columns in order being name, molecular weight, KxA, valence, film transfer coefficient, and surface diffusion coefficient. Chloride, Sulfate, Bicarbonate, and Nitrate should always be in the ions tab.

### Initial Concentration

The initial concentration represents the ratio of a mass to a given volume in this case is mg/L. The time of the final concentration determines the run duration of the analysis. As the model stands now, there is no data in the model to represent the concentration after the final concentration time. There have been discussions to plot data past the final concentration time but these will just be estimations.


### Output Concentration
The output concentration is given in units of mass divided by volume, however, this number is also adjusted 
### Output Time
The output time on the parameters tab represents the time units in the
